## Get Started 
 
1. Put environments on ```.env``` using the ```.env.example``` as guide
2. Generate ORM needed files ```go run github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go generate```
3. Run the containers ```docker-compose up```
4. Up Migrations ```go run github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go migrate dev```


### Business Logic

- Every user has ONE Wallet
- Every Wallet start with *WALLET_BALANCE_INIT* (set environment) coins
- User can send/receive coins
- Shopkeeper can only receive coins

### Auth

Users can be created calling a POST request to ```/user``` with a json containing *email*, *password*, *cpf*, *name* and *lastname*. 

Example:

```json
{
  "email": "john@doe.com",
  "password": "12345678",
  "name": "john",
  "lastname": "doe",
  "cpf": "123456789"
}
```

After created, login can be done by calling a POST request to ```/user/login``` with a json containing the *email* and *password*

Example:

```json
{
  "email": "john@doe.com",
    "password": "12345678"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImxsZW9uZXNvdXphNDMxMkBsaXZlLmNvbSIsImlkIjoiY2Q2NTU2YjktZjk1ZC00MmM0LWJhYzgtOTQwNjk5NDc0MTY0IiwiZXhwIjoxNjc1Mzg4ODIxfQ.z29cwjAuaHlE8ee1mVYf5lyO6owmPYTiouqxojs6cF4"
}
```

Now the *token* can be used as *Bearer Token* to make request to protected routes, the same logic works for Shopkeeper.
